This project is Mobile Engieer Take-Home Assignment for TYME 

❖ User Story:
As an administrator, it is possible to browse all users who are the members of
GitHub site then we can see more detailed information about them.

❖ Acceptance Criteria:
- The administrator can look through fetched users’ information.
- The administrator can scroll down to see more users’ information with 20
items per fetch.
- Users’ information must be shown immediately when the administrator
launches the application for the second time.
- Clicking on an item will navigate to the page of user details.

❖ Important Notice:
- Using any architecture/model you prefer, but scalable and reusable.
- Application is implemented for native Android or native iOS using Kotlin or Swift, but both are a big plus.
- Unit testing must be applied on the project.
- Remember to write documentation comments in Kotlin files (Android) or Swift files (iOS).
- XCode version: feel free to choose the familiar Xcode version which you
wanna use to develop this exercise.
- Remember to compress the project with source code only (excluding generated build, outputs...).

❖ Timeline: 1 week
